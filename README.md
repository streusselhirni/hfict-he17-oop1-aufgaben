# Exersices for the programming course at [HF-ICT](http://www.hf-ict.ch)

This repository contains my solutions to the exercies from the course "Object-Orientiertes Programmieren 1" (object-oriented programming 1) which is held at [hf-ict](http://www.hf-ict.ch).

The solutions are added as soon as the corresponding exercise has been completed by me and thus are not complete. If you have any questions or requests, create an issue and I am happy to respond.

[Here it starts with Kapitel 1 (chapter 1)](https://github.com/streusselhirni/hfict-he17-oop1-aufgaben/tree/master/kapitel1).
